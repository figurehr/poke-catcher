**ENG-153:**

Job Story: When I read my Pokedex, I would like to see a list of Pokemon so that I can learn more about certain Pokemon.

This ticket involves X engineering tasks.

1. Render a Pokemon card using the below design.
   Use the provided `<Pokemon />` component and example API response (in `ListPokemon.js`) to create the card.
2. Once we have a working card, create a grid of pokemon using the
   actual API. The API request is already created, you just need to hook it up and make the cards look good together.
3. Add the ability to select a card by clicking on it and display the
   combined HP of the selected Pokemon in the "Total HP" box in `ListPokemon.js`
